				<h1 class="main-title">The Outback Way: Is this the world's emptiest road?</h1>
				<div class="main-img img">
					<img src="img/road.webp" alt="Beautiful landscape| Road through Dessert">
				</div>
				<div class="subimg-text">Stretching 2,700km from Laverton in Western Australia to Winton in far-off
					Queensland,
					the Outback Way is a great diagonal "shortcut" across the nation that saves weeks of travel.
				</div>
				<p>Laverton is the kind of outback town you might expect at the end of an epic desert road trip, not at the
					start of one. Marooned on the edge of Australia's two largest deserts – the Victoria and the Great Sandy
					–
					Laverton felt like the last outpost of frontier civilisation, a 12-hour drive from Perth, five hours from
					already-remote Kalgoorlie.</p>
				<p>Whenever a road train rumbled through town, Laverton rouses into life. Otherwise, it is eerily,
					gloriously
					quiet. Tarmac roads disappear beneath the red sand long before they reach the town's outskirts. When the
					wind picks up, the sand turns to dust and blankets the town with a fine, coppery sheen. After the dust
					settles, when darkness falls, the stars come out, more stars than seem possible.</p>
				<p>Laverton, founded on the traditional lands of the Wongutha and Tjalkanti people, marks the starting point
					of
					the Outback Way, also known in Western Australia as the Great Central Road. One of the world's great
					transcontinental traverses, it was laid out by Len Beadell in the 1950s in what was surely one of the
					road-building achievements of the time; from 1947 until 1963, Beadell forged more than 6,000km of outback
					tracks for the Australian government. The marks his bulldozers left behind in the desert sands terrified
					desert peoples who wondered what great animal had passed this way.

					<p class="text-descr">
						Standing here nearly 70 years later, there were signs to what lay ahead: the Great Beyond Visitor
						Centre;
						the Explorers Hall of Fame; the big-sky views of an endless desert landscape from Windarra Lookout.
						And
						before setting out, it was difficult not to contemplate the enormity of the undertaking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tracking north-west, connecting one side of Australia to the other, the Outback Way is the most direct
						route
						through the heart of the country. Along the 2,700km from Laverton in Western Australia to Winton in
						far-off
						Queensland, the Outback Way passes through countless indigenous homelands, skirts isolated national
						parks
						and stops in at life-saving outback roadhouses. It ultimately connects Perth with Cairns in a great
						diagonal
						shortcut that cuts thousands of kilometres (and weeks of travel) from the paved route that follows the
						coast
						for part of the way. As a road trip, it captures the essence of outback travel as it once was.
					</p>
					<div>
						<span>
							But, perhaps, all of that may soon be about to change.
						</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						At first after I left Laverton, it was difficult to understand why the Outback Way is considered such
						an
						epic crossing: the road was paved; the going was easy; and the thrill of departure kept at bay any
						awareness
						that ahead lay one of the longest and emptiest roads on the planet.

						A drive down Bolivia's infamous "Death Road" takes travellers into a world where two resources have
						provoked
						fascination, misunderstanding and controversy for centuries: coca and gold.
					</div>
					<p>After cresting the 4,800m Cumbre pass, the trufi (shared taxi) plunged into a cloud of swirling mist.
						Inside
						the vehicle it felt strangely peaceful, as if we were trapped in a bubble, which was perhaps for the
						best
						given we were travelling along the "Camino de la Muerte", or Death Road.
					</p>
					<p>
						Running from the high-altitude Andean city of La Paz to the subtropical Yungas valleys and the
						Amazonian
						lowlands beyond, the 64km Yungas Road involves a sharp 3,500m descent. Parts of the highway are only
						3m
						wide; there is a series of sharp turns and blind corners; and mini waterfalls splash down the
						surrounding
						rockface. Safety barriers make only a rare appearance – far more common are roadside shrines: white
						crosses,
						bunches of flowers, yellowing photos.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the 1990s, so many people died in accidents on the highway – built by Paraguayan prisoners of
						war
						following the catastrophic Chaco War (1932-35) – that the Inter-American Development Bank described it
						as
						"the world's most dangerous road".
					</p>
					<p>
						The trufi slowed to a crawl and the driver hunched forward, peering intently over the steering wheel
						as
						if
						at an eye test, before we suddenly emerged into the sunshine. Outside my window was a near-vertical
						1,000m
						drop, while on the opposite side a motorbike whizzed past, clipping our wing mirror. Just ahead, a
						trio
						of
						cyclists gingerly navigated a crater-sized pothole: although a bypass has been built around the most
						perilous stretch, the road's macabre reputation has made it something of a tourist attraction and it
						attracts a steady stream of travellers eager to ride down it.
					</p>
					<p>The route is also the gateway to an overlooked region with powerful associations. The Yungas ("warm
						lands"
						in the indigenous language of Aymara, spoken by around 1.7 million Bolivians) are a fertile,
						remarkably
						biodiverse transition zone between the Andes and the Amazon, closely linked to two resources that have
						provoked fascination and reverence, misunderstanding and controversy: coca and gold.</p>

				<p style="color: burlywood; text-indent: 20px;">After two hours on the Death Road, we pulled into Coroico,
					once a gold-mining
					hub, now a languid resort
					town. Wedged into an emerald-green slope, it has a balmy climate and panoramic views of undulating hills,
					along with good-value places to eat, drink and sleep. Coroico is a difficult place to leave, but after
					spending a day recovering from the nerve-wracking journey, I headed into the surrounding countryside to
					learn more about how the region has helped to shape modern Bolivia.
				</p>
				<h2>Coca has been central to many South American cultures for millennia</h2>
				<p>Coca has been central to many South American cultures for millennia, and Bolivia is one of the
					continent's
					biggest producers, with hundreds of square kilometres devoted to the crop, two-thirds of which are in the
					Yungas. High in vitamins and minerals, the leaves act as a mild stimulant and help to offset altitude
					sickness; stave off hunger, thirst and tiredness; aid digestion and even suppress pain. For as long as
					8,000
					years, they have been used in religious ceremonies, and as a medicine, currency and social lubricant.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Spanish initially demonised coca. But after realising the beneficial effect it had on the indigenous
					peoples forced to toil in mines and on plantations, the colonial authorities had a change of heart and
					commercialised the crop. Interest in coca slowly grew beyond the continent. The first English-language
					reference is believed to be Londoner Abraham Cowley's 1662 poem, A Legend of Coca:
				</p>
				<p>During the 19th Century, coca – and its psychoactive alkaloid, cocaine – proved increasingly popular in
					Europe and North America, featuring in drinks, tonics, medicines and various other products. They
					included
					Vin Mariani, a French wine with more than 200mg/litre of cocaine. Adverts claimed it "refreshed body and
					brain" and fans included Thomas Edison, Ulysses S Grant, Emile Zola and Pope Leo XIII (who even appeared
					on
					a promotional poster).</p>

					<h2 class="countless-rumours-block-title">Countless rumours of lost fortunes and hidden treasures have
						swirled around the Yungas and neighbouring
						regions.
					</h2>
					<p class="countless-rumours-block-text">Percy <span>Harrison Fawcett</span>, an eccentric British
						explorer who spent
						years travelling through South America in
						the
						early 20th Century, provides a flavour of this gold fever. In his book Exploration Fawcett, he
						described
						a
						story about a "big treasure" buried by the Jesuits in a tunnel near the Sacambaya River, which winds
						through
						the southern Yungas. "On learning of their impending expulsion… the [Jesuit] gold was gathered at
						Sacambaya…
						and it took six months to close up the tunnel,' Fawcett wrote. The six indigenous Bolivians who dug
						the
						tunnel
						and seven of the eight priests who knew of its whereabouts were subsequently killed to protect the
						secret,
						he
						added. (Fawcett himself ultimately disappeared while searching for the supposed lost Amazonian city of
						'Z'.)
						Despite a distinct lack of evidence, this form of tantalising myth has proved remarkably resilient.
